# Project 2 Stage 4 "Triple Peaks Coffee Shop"

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- adding a hover pseudo class that plays the beginning of the video in recipes section
- add more animations similar to the pulse that have to do with coffee
- add images of menu items
- add input field for those particular about their coffee, for example maybe they want non dairy milk or want to add an extra shot
- add an allergies checklist
- maybe change the way the header is designed because on smaller windows the text overlaps the image and the background color of the image can be seen
